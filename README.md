# Note-Tracker
This is a note taker designed with JS and Express.JS

## Description

This was designed to give me practice with developing a backend server that uses API calls to retrieve and save data for the user.
The intent is to create a simple note taker that takes input from a user and saves that input into a local database that the user can retrieve, view and delete.

## Usage
To use, you will need: 

    Node.js
    NPM
    Express.js

    OPTIONAL: 
    NODEMON for updating changes to server on save

To run the server for the website, input:
    
    node server.js
    OR
    nodemon server.js

This will run the server which you can open by navigating to your broswer and inputing into the address bar:

    localhost:3001/

This will navigate you to the index.html and allow you to navigate the application.
